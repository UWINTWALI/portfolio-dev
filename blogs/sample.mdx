# Building a Tiny Web Component

This is a short, dummy technical post to demonstrate the blog listing on the portfolio site.

We create a very small web component that renders a greeting. This example uses plain JavaScript and is intentionally minimal.
Add a sample MDX post
```html
<script>
	class HelloCard extends HTMLElement {
		connectedCallback() {
			this.innerHTML = `
				<div style="padding:16px;border:1px solid #e5e7eb;border-radius:8px;">
					<strong>Hello, web components!</strong>
					<div>Built with plain JS for demo purposes.</div>
				</div>`;
		}
	}
	customElements.define('hello-card', HelloCard);
// Use: <hello-card></hello-card>
</script>
```

Conclusion: this little example shows how simple components can be encapsulated and reused. Replace this content with your real post when ready.

Want me to create another sample with MDX components (React) or keep this plain MDX example?
